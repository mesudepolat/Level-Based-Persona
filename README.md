# Level-Based-Persona

I made new customer definitions using some of the characteristics of customers that
exist in the singular. I segmented the clients according to price. I've determined
which segment a new customer might belong to.


## Project Steps

* Thinking about the concept of persona.
* To be able to define new customers according to the levels.
* Simply segment new customer definitions using the qcut function.
* When a new customer arrives, classify them according to segments.
